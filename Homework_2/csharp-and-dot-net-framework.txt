It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language
interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming 
languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to 
hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that
provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together
constitute .NET Framework.
